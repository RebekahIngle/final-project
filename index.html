            <p>Oleander Pride is an annual community event hosted by neighbors in the historic Oleander neighborhood located in downtown Bakersfield. 
                Every June, artists from Creative Crossings create temporary chalk art celebrating Pride throughout the neighborhood.
                Members of the LGBTQ+ community and allies are invited to meet up at Beale Park and tour the art installations
                together during this family-friendly celebration of love and diversity in Bakersfield.
